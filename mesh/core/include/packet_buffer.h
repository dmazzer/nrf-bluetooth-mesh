/**
 * @defgroup PACKET_BUFFER Packet Buffer
 * @ingroup MESH_CORE
 * Provides functionality for managing packet buffers.
 *
 * # Packet manager design
 * The packet manager provides functions for initializing packet manager instances and allocating
 * and deallocating packet buffers.
 *
 * The packet manager design is based on three critical assumptions:
 *
 * - One consumer and multiple producers.
 * - The packets are consumed in the same order they are produced.
 * - The consumer frees a popped packet before popping the next.
 *
 * There are 5 states a packet buffer may be in:
 *
 * - `FREE` : Available to producers to acquire and use.
 * - `RESERVED`: Acquired by and in use by the producer. This state is entered by the
 *               packet_buffer_reserve() function.
 * - `COMMITED`: Available to the consumer to acquire and read. This state is entered by the
 *               packet_buffer_commit() function.
 * - `POPPED`: Acquired by and in use of the consumer. This state is entered by calling the
 *             packet_buffer_pop() function. The consumer has to make a packet_buffer_free()
 *             call on this packet before it can acquire another packet.
 * - `SKIPPED`: A packet that was dropped by the producer (not commited). It has no meaningful
 *              information but have to be freed by a call to packet_buffer_pop() made by the consumer.
 *              There are two scenarios that can cause a packet to be in this state:
 *   1. The available space before the buffer wrap-around is not sufficient to satisfy a reserve
 *      call, but the space starting from buffer 0 and up is sufficient. In this case the buffer
 *      is skipped, as illustrated by the image below.
 *   2. The producer decides to free a buffer after reserving it, but there have already been
 *      other reservations of packets made that follow the freed buffer. In this case, the freed
 *      buffer cannot be treated as a free buffer in order to avoid holes in the packet manager.
 *   
 * ![Producer/Consumer](packet_mgr_producer_consumer.svg)
 *
 * # Initializing
 *
 * Due to the limitation that only one consumer can use a packet buffer at a time, the problem
 * of having multiple consumers (such as when using multiple advertisers) is solved by using multiple packet
 * buffer instances, where the buffers are managed independently. Each packet buffer instance is
 * created by a call to packet_buffer_init(), which accepts a pool of memory, the size of the pool
 * and creates an initialized packet manager instance.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * static uint8_t buffer[128];
 * packet_buffer_t packet_buffer;
 * uint32_t status = packet_buffer_init(&packet_buffer, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
 * @endcode
 *
 * ![Initial packet buffer state](packet_mgr_initial_state.svg)
 *
 * # Reserving packets
 *
 * Packet buffers are reserved using the packet_buffer_reserve() function.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * // Reserve a 10-byte packet
 * packet_buffer_packet_t * p_packet;
 * uint32_t status = packet_buffer_reserve(&packet_buffer, &p_packet, 10);
 * @endcode
 *
 * ![Packet buffer state after reserving a buffer](packet_mgr_reserve_1.svg)
 *
 * After allocating a second packet, the packet buffer contains two reserved buffers:
 *
 * ![Packet buffer state after reserving two buffers](packet_mgr_reserve_2.svg)
 *
 * # Committing packets
 *
 * Packet buffers are committed using the packet_mgr_commit() function.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * // Commit the first reserved packet:
 * packet_buffer_commit(&packet_buffer, p_packet, 10);
 * @endcode
 *
 * ![Packet buffer state after committing the first reserved buffer](packet_mgr_commit.svg)
 *
 * # Popping packets
 *
 * Packet buffers are popped using the packet_buffer_pop() function.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * // Pop the first packet:
 * packet_mgr_packet_t * p_popped_packet;
 * uint32_t status = packet_buffer_pop(&packet_buffer, &p_popped_packet);
 * @endcode
 *
 * ![Packet buffer state after popping the first packet buffer](packet_mgr_pop.svg)
 *
 * # Freeing packets
 *
 * Freeing packet buffers is done using the packet_buffer_free() function.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * // Free the popped packet buffer:
 * uint32_t status = packet_mgr_free(&packet_buffer, &p_popped_packet);
 * @endcode
 *
 * ![Packet buffer state after freeing the previously popped buffer](packet_mgr_free_1.svg)
 *
 * After freeing the remaining reserved buffer, the state of the packet buffer becomes:
