/**
 * @defgroup HEARTBEAT Heartbeat module
 * @ingroup MESH_CORE
 *
 * The Heartbeat module provides functionality for sending and receiving heartbeat messages.
 * Configuration of this module is controlled by two states: the Heartbeat
 * Publication state and the Heartbeat Subscription state, defined in the Mesh Profile
 * Specification v1.0.
 *
 * The Heartbeat Publication state is contained within the Config Server module, and Heartbeat Subscription state
 * is part of the Heartbeat module.
 *
 * The Config server uses @ref heartbeat_publication_state_updated() to inform the heartbeat module about
 * publication state changes and the @ref heartbeat_subscription_set() function to set the
 * subscription state. This module is also tightly integrated with the @c transport module. The module
 * registers its internal opcode handler function with the transport layer during initialization.
 *
 * @warning Currently, heartbeat publication and subscription states are not stored in flash.
 *
 * # Receiving heartbeat messages
 * The transport layer calls the registered heartbeat opcode handler  after receiving a
 * @ref TRANSPORT_CONTROL_OPCODE_HEARTBEAT message. The opcode handler then parses
 * the message to derive the initial TTL value used to send this message, calculates the hop count between
 * the current and the originating nodes, and generates
 * an @ref NRF_MESH_EVT_HB_MESSAGE_RECEIVED event for the user application.
 *
 * # Sending heartbeat messages
 * Heartbeat messages can be sent periodically by configuring the Heartbeat Publication state.
 * Heartbeat messages can also be triggered if the state of the node's
 * features (Relay, Proxy, Friendship, and LPN features) change as a result of feature
 * configuration messages or local action. To trigger heartbeat messages on feature
 * state changes, @ref heartbeat_on_feature_change_trigger() is called with the appropriate
 * parameters.
