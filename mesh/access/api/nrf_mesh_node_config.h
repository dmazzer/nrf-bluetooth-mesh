 * Application support module for common mesh behavior.
 *
 * The node config module is a helper module designed to make it easy to get started developing
 * applications with the mesh, by providing an abstraction of the common configuration APIs.
 * Contrary to the base API, the node config module aims to satisfy only the most common usage
 * scenarios, which makes it suitable for simple applications.
 *
 * It is recommended to start out using the node config module as a scaffolding, then phase it out
 * if fine-grained control is needed.
