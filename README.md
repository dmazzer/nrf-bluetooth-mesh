# Introduction to nRF5 SDK for Mesh

The nRF5 SDK for Mesh is Nordic Semiconductor's implementation of the Bluetooth Mesh. It allows
applications to utilize the features provided by the Bluetooth Mesh when running on Nordic's
nRF5 Series chips.

See the [Getting started guides](@ref md_doc_getting_started_getting_started) for more information
on
@subpage md_doc_introduction_basic_concepts,
@subpage md_doc_introduction_basic_architecture,
[installing the mesh toolchain](@ref md_doc_getting_started_how_to_toolchain),
[building the mesh stack](@ref md_doc_getting_started_how_to_build), and more.

Make sure to check the [release notes](@ref md_RELEASE_NOTES) for the current release.

**Important:**
In an application using nRF5 SDK for Mesh, interrupt priorities need to be considered carefully,
see @ref md_doc_getting_started_mesh_interrupt_priorities.

## Compatibility
The nRF5 SDK for Mesh has no direct dependencies on
the @link_nRF5SDK<!--nRF5 SDK: https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF5-SDK-->,
but see @ref md_doc_getting_started_how_to_nordicSDK for instructions on how to integrate the two SDKs.

The mesh stack is compatible with the following configurations:

| SoC       | Board(s)            | SoftDevice(s)               |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| nRF52840  | PCA10056            | S140 v5.0.1-Alpha           |
| nRF52832  | PCA10040            | S132 v3.\* / v4.\* / v5.\*  |
| nRF51xxx  | PCA10028 / PCA10031 | S130 v2.0.1 / S110 v8.0.0   |

The mesh stack is also compatible with the nRF52810 platform, but not supported by the current build system.
