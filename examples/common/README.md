# Common example modules

Modules that are common to the mesh examples.


## Simple hardware abstraction layer

The simple hardware abstraction layer is a module that provides simple drivers for
the buttons and LEDs on development kits. It is used in the various mesh example
projects.


## RTT input

The RTT input module enables the examples to poll the RTT for input characters. It uses a timer (NRF_TIMER2) to avoid busy-waiting.
